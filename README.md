This program uses Decision Trees (DTs) to train the classifier to be able to classify if the data feed falls in the category of the iris dataset i.e setosa,verscolor and virginica
Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. 
The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
